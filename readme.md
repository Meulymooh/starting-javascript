## Part 1

Duration: 0.5 day.

What I learned:
- Keyup event: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_onkeyup_addeventlistener

## Part 2

Duration: 1 day.

What I learned:
- Add new row: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_table_insertrow.asp
- Delete row: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_table_deleterow.asp
- KeyboardEvent / keyCode Property: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_key_keycode.asp

## Part 3

Duration: 1 day.

What I learned:
- Remove (text, element...): https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_removechild.asp
- Create list from array: https://memorynotfound.com/dynamically-addremove-items-list-javascript/
- Add input in separate block below the list: https://gomakethings.com/how-to-insert-an-element-after-another-one-in-the-dom-with-vanilla-javascript/
- Click out of the input => blur() method : https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_html_blur.asp

Remarks:
- First try: I cheated big time. Instead of "updating" the list, I actually "recreated" it with the extra ingredient in it. My list was created after I read about "Looping Array Elements" (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp), but I didn't manage to find a clean way to update the list. 
- Second try: after a little bit of guidance in terms of where to look for information, I rewrote my functions "createList" and  "updateList". I also added "removeInput" (it was still there at first try).

## Part 4: 

What I learned:
- Filter/search list: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_table.aspasp
