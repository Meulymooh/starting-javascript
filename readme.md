Part 2:
- Add new row: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_table_insertrow.asp
- Delete row: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_table_deleterow.asp

Part 3 :
- Remove text: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_removechild.asp
- Create list from array: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp
- Add input in separate block below the list: https://gomakethings.com/how-to-insert-an-element-after-another-one-in-the-dom-with-vanilla-javascript/
- Click out of the input => blur() method : https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_html_blur.asp
- I cheated big time: instead of "updating" the list, I'm actually "recreating" it with the extra ingredient in it. I didn't manage to find how to update the list in a clean way. But I'm very imaginative. Applaud!
